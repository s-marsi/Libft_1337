    git clone https://github.com/s-marsi/libft.git libft
    cd libft
    ```
2. Compile the library:
    ```bash
    make all bonus  # This will generate the libft.a library file.
    make clean      # This will remove object files.
    ```
## Usage :
- To use the libft library in your C project, include the header file in your source code and link against the compiled library.</li>
